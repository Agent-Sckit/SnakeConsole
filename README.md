# SnakeConsole
A game of snake using console

I used ISO C++14 standard of the visual studio 2022.
I did not used any console API on this matter.
Also, I did used OOP in this setup for demonstration purposes.
There are a lot of improvments can be done here and I will be updating this code whenever possible.
